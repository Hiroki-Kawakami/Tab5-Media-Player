# Architecture

## Layout

| path | what it is |
|---|---|
| `app/` | the firmware, shared verbatim by both targets (device + host simulator) |
| `components/` | project-specific plain-C components (`avi_demux`) |
| `esp32p4/` | ESP-IDF wrapper for the Tab5: sdkconfig, partition table, `app_main` |
| `simulator/` | host wrapper: SDL/host `main`, its own sdkconfig |
| `simulator/verify/` | harness scripts for headless UI checks |
| `esp-devkit/` | submodule: BSP, LVGL port, `ui_framework`, harness |

Everything shared lives in esp-devkit and is consumed through `devkit.cmake`
(`devkit_idf_init` / `devkit_simulator`). Reusable board/simulator/UI
infrastructure is advanced in esp-devkit first, then this repo bumps the
submodule pointer. Project-specific components go under a top-level
`components/` and are added to both wrappers' `COMPONENT_DIRS`.

`app/CMakeLists.txt` globs its sources with `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`: the
simulator's Ninja build otherwise never re-scans the tree, and a newly added
`.cpp` fails at link time until someone reconfigures by hand (`idf.py` always
reconfigures, so the device build hides this). The flag is dropped under
`CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE` because ESP-IDF's requirement scan includes component
CMakeLists in script mode, where it is a hard error.

`app_entry()` in `app/media_player.cpp` is the single entry point for both
targets: `bsp_init()`, the esp-devkit LVGL port, `display_manager.create_display()`,
then the first screen. `esp32p4/main/main.cpp` and `simulator/main/main.cpp` only
call it.

The media pipeline (containers, decode, presentation, audio, and the extension
points left for MKV/H.264/playlists) is described in [`playback.md`](playback.md).

## SD card

The card is mounted at `/sdcard` when the Home screen's SD Card button is
pressed, not at boot, so a card inserted after power-on still works and a
missing card surfaces as a modal rather than a log line. It is never unmounted.

`FileBrowserScreen` classifies entries by `dirent::d_type` rather than `stat`:
on FAT every `stat` is another directory scan, which adds up on a folder of
hundreds of files. Entries starting with `.` are skipped, which also hides the
`._*` AppleDouble files macOS leaves on cards.

On the simulator `bsp_sd_mount` redirects `/sdcard` to a host directory
(`esp-devkit/bsp/simulator/sd_redirect.c`). Its default is relative to the
process cwd, and the harness launches the simulator from wherever `run.sh` was
invoked, so `run.sh` pins `SIMULATOR_SDCARD_PATH` to `simulator/sdcard`
(gitignored — put test media there).

Row labels use the Montserrat fonts, which have no CJK glyphs: non-ASCII file
names render as missing-glyph boxes until a font covering them is loaded.

## Harness

`CONFIG_HARNESS=y` is set for the device build (the simulator always has it),
so `./run.sh simulator --verify` / `./run.sh esp32p4 --verify` can inject touches and read the panel
back as JPEG. The console is USB-Serial-JTAG, which is what keeps full-panel
captures fast. The harness links the JPEG encoder, which is why the factory
partition is 4M rather than `singleapp`'s default. Coordinates in scripts are
panel pixels (720x1280 portrait). See `esp-devkit/docs/harness.md`.

Opening the USB-Serial-JTAG port resets the board, so every
`./run.sh esp32p4 --verify` starts from a fresh boot on the Home screen. A
script cannot pick up where a previous run left off; drive the whole path from
Home in one script.
